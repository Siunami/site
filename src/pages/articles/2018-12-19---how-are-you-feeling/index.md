I built this [website](http://www.howareyoufeeling.xyz/) to ask a simple question. How are you feeling? You can share your response anonymously and read the anonymous responses from others.

This is in response to two of the [problems I’ve been thinking about](http://www.matthewsiu.com/problems-im-thinking-about/) recently. Empathy and loneliness. In the moments where you struggle in life, it's easy to think you're the only one. Social media can paint a false reality of the human experience without the bad and the ugly.

My hope is that this website might help people in two ways:

1. Remember there are many other people out there struggling with some of the same things you are. You are not alone.
2. Feel comfortable sharing very personal struggles on an anonymous forum. Sharing them could help as a cathartic release of emotions.

> The good, the bad, the beautiful, the ugly, the happy, the sad—they’re all part of the human experience.
