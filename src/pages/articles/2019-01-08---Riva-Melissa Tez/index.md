Really enjoyed the interview with [Riva-Melissa Tez by The Mission](https://themissiondaily.com/episode-100/) and wanted to share some points mentioned that resonated with me.

**Life is a game**

> _“We never had to take any of it seriously, did we?”_
> 
> \- Ayn Rand

This quote in the book Atlas Shrugged condenses Ayn Rand’s point of view on life. For someone who barely escaped the USSR and nearly starved in the process, she believed, “the essence of life is the achievement of joy, not the escape from pain.”

A key point here is that reality is malleable. You can interpret reality in many different ways and choose to play by a unique set of rules. Riva’s career to date embodies this idea from running a toy store, starting a tech startup three months into learning to code and breaking into venture capital without the traditional credentials many people think are required. Life is just a game that we are all creating as we go along. Define your narrative and aspire to achieve it.

**Spread critical reasoning tools**

One important tool that needs to be shared more broadly are critical reasoning tools. Problems are complex and cannot always be solved by throwing money at them. An example would be people thinking Jeff Bezos should fix homelessness in Seattle by giving his wealth away. What you really want him to do is address the root problem. Giving people money without the decision making structures on how to use it effectively will not solve the problem of homelessness in itself. When you ask why a problem exists in the first place, there is usually a deep systemic issue that has yet to be understood. This is what you need to focus on to create long term change.

**On being creative**

Nothing is completely original. Everything is a remix of other people’s work. One of Riva’s favorite musical works is Max Richter’s re-working of Vivaldi’s Four Seasons. He takes a classic piece and fine tunes it to appeal to the current time period. Take a listen. The ending left me with goosebumps. Riva talks more about why she likes this piece in her essay, [Love and Beauty in a time of machine intelligence](https://www.theeuropean-magazine.com/riva-melissa-tez/9467-love-and-beauty-in-a-time-of-machine-intelligence).

**Benefits of writing**

Writing in public serves as a beacon for people to find you. People get a chance to know you better and you get to meet similar minded people. It also opens the doors to new opportunities which increases the amount of spontaneity in life.

You don’t need to know all the answers to start writing. Write to share what you currently believe in and become better when you are wrong. Writing in public is like having a community of mentors making you better.
