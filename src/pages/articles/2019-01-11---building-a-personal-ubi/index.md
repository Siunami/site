People are already creating their own UBI today and they call it FIRE (Financially independent, retire early). There is an entire community sharing advice for how to get to FIRE. This [article](https://twocents.lifehacker.com/the-basics-of-fire-financial-independence-and-early-re-1820129768) is a great overview but in short, through a combination of revenue streams, interest on investments and tax deductions, people create the option to retire early and gain control of their time. For many, including myself, the goal is not to stop working but to have the freedom to pursue anything without worrying about how it will make you money. With FIRE, you can afford to take huge risks with potentially high returns, quit a job you don’t like or drop everything to learn a new skill.

As mentioned above, there are 3 key strategies to reach FIRE:

**Build** **Revenue Streams**

1. buy an existing asset
2. launch a product on a marketplace with existing demand
3. launch a unique, one of a kind product in a new space where you can buy demand (adwords, facebook, etc.)
4. arbitrage (craigslist, airbnb, trading, uber)

For more details, check out Justin Mares [blog post](http://justinmares.com/the-4-kinds-of-side-businesses-you-can-start/) from which I got these 4 categories.

**Invest**

Grow you nest egg to a point where you can live off the interest it accrues.

**Tax Deductions**

This article has a lot of good practical advice for taking advantage of tax deductions.

A combination of all three strategies is critical to creating a sustainable stream of income. Ultimately, FIRE provides you a high degree of optionality in life. The new wealth of today is not exorbitant luxuries but rather control of your own time.
