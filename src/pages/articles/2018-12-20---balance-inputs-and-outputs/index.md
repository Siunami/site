Knowledge without application is useless. However, in a complex world abundant in information, it is easy to get overwhelmed into inaction.

Over time, I've slowly come to terms with the fact that I will only ever know the smallest sliver of everything there is to learn. I'm okay with that. Most everyone is winging it at this very moment. The key is to find the courage to act even though you don't feel ready and don't know all the answers. Form a hypothesis and commit fully to testing it. Answers will become clearer once you begin. Knowledge and application form a compounding positive feedback loop.

Don't worry about not being ready. Just get started.
