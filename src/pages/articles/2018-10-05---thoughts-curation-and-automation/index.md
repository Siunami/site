I want to start a blog series where I share links and talk about the ideas/topics I've been thinking about. Always looking to hear different perspectives so reach out if you want to talk more!

## **Curation**

A recent problem that I have been thinking about is how we separate signal from noise. In an age of information abundance, finding and discovering high quality information is a hard problem. Curated lists are fundamental to how we navigate information abundance. Google creates lists of links by search terms. Netflix curates lists of movies and tv shows. Facebook curates lists of posts by our friends. Pinterest allows users to create lists of imagery and links that inspire them.

Whether curated algorithmically, by humans or a mix of both, curation plays a fundamental role in saving people enormous amounts of time finding information.

I really enjoyed these three pieces by [Robin Good](https://medium.com/@robingood) that go into detail on the varied approaches, benefits and the future of curation. One key learning was recognizing that the curator role is just as important as the creator role.

- [Content Curation Approaches: Types and Formats](https://medium.com/content-curation-official-guide/content-curation-approaches-types-and-formats-ae2b33fe6a18)
- [The Key Benefits of Content Curation](https://medium.com/content-curation-official-guide/the-key-benefits-of-content-curation-7d83837c2163)
- [Content Curation Future Impact](https://medium.com/content-curation-official-guide/content-curation-future-impact-3434b7dccdef)  
    

Extending on this was an article by [Steve Buttry](https://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/) that went into the [specific value that curators add](https://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2012/07/19/curation-techniques-types-and-tips/).

[Maria Popova](https://www.brainpickings.org/about/) wrote about how curation plays a fundamental role in discovery and also in identifying underlying themes by connecting knowledge. Curation is an art and those who do it serve as a trusted guide to new ideas.

- [Networked Knowledge and Combinatorial Creativity](https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/08/01/networked-knowledge-combinatorial-creativity/)  
    

With the excess of information, making sense of it and turning it into a story is becoming more important than generating it. [Fred Wilson](https://avc.com/) argued media companies can shift to an [aggregation/curation model](https://avc.com/2009/06/aggregate-curate-publish-to-create-local-media/) sifting the web for information and then crafting a story around it.

## **Automation**

An [article by the Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/agents-of-automation/568795/?single_page=true) sparked a new exploration into automation for me. While automation is creating huge surplus value, much of the value is being captured by a small group that owns production. While Keynes argued automation would liberate large portions of the individuals time, most individuals still work for significant portions of the week. Automation has unfortunately only exacerbated economic inequality.

Links shared in the Atlantic article above along with conversations on this [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18120322) brought up a growing movement of software programmers automating themselves out of a job. 

In looking to explore this more, here are some resources that provide practical information/tools on how to automate tasks in your own work.

- [How I automated my job with Node.js](https://medium.com/dailyjs/how-i-automated-my-job-with-node-js-94bf4e423017)
- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)  
    
- [Sikuli](http://www.sikuli.org/) (Visual automation tool)  
    
- Scheduling or rerunning a service (cronjob, shell, ruby)
- Browser automation (Selenium IDE and Webdriver)
- Zapier  
    

Long term solutions that allow the largest possible group to benefit will require policy and/or economic changes. Universal Basic Income is an interesting proposal.

## **Miscellaneous**

A couple other things I've been thinking about recently..
