The idea of mimetic desire is discussed a lot recently with people interested in technology, complexity and society. It's the idea that what you desire is imitated from observing what others desire or have. There is the desire for non-material things that others have like knowledge or skills. Then there is the desire for material things like wealth, power, fame and mates. Material things are scarce. If you get your own desires from copying others, then you will naturally begin to desire the same scarce resources which creates conflict. This conflict forms rivalries between individuals that cascade across society.

Girard suggests that when these conflicts get too intense, those affected by the conflict unconsciously attempt to identify a scapegoat. Someone to blame the conflict on. By unifying to sacrifice the scapegoat, the group may temporarily find peace. For example, a nation's people might blame its president when the stock market collapses. If the nation unites to vote that president out and the stock market recovers, it may seem like the conflict has resolved leading to a period of peace. In reality, presidents usually have less influence than what society often attributes to them. The recovery in the stock market was likely the result of a more complex underlying system.

This scapegoat mechanism plays out in nearly all positions of power where both success and failure are over attributed to the leader. Some think that the knowledge of this scapegoat mechanism may allow us to overcome it. By being more specific about the things we desire we may be able to minimize conflicts and live in better harmony. For some things, maybe this would be possible. For other deeply biological needs like food, shelter and mates, there might always be this conflict.

The scapegoat mechanism seems to be a response to trying to make sense of a world that is far more complex than we can imagine. We hyper simplify the scenario labeling a single entity as the source of the problem. A unified response by a large number of individuals towards the scapegoat may influence a complex environment in the short term. Yet if the problem still exists, conflict will inevitably reappear leading to a new scapegoat.

This is an idea I plan to explore in greater detail.
