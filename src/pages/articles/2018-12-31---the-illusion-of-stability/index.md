One thing I've come to realize is that stability is an illusion. School, work, relationships and life are always in flux. It's easy to assume something will remain a constant until suddenly and abruptly, it ends. Yet the end is what leaves space for something new. The challenge, discomfort and uncertainty that come with this change is how we grow. Keep going.
