I agree with Theodor Adorno’s idealistic perspective that leisure time should be an opportunity to expand and develop ourselves. To arm ourselves with new ideas and tools to tackle future problems. Yet today, leisure time is filled by media companies vying to gain the largest portion of our attention. Attention is the critical commodity of the modern age and it is being directed towards viewing a constant stream of violence on the news (fear) and watching dramas like the Kardashian’s (gossip). I don’t believe this is the wrongdoing of any one person but rather, a product of biology and the system we live in.</p>\n<p>When humans were organized in hunter gatherer societies, fear and gossip served as critical functions to survival. Our biology was fine-tuned to pay attention to them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paying attention to things we <em>feared</em> allowed us to identify dangers and helped us learn what to avoid in our environment.</li>\n<li><em>Gossip</em> allowed us to maintain larger social groups. We didn’t need to have lengthy interactions with every person in the group to know who we wanted to partner with or coordinate with. The reputations of people spoke for themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As I mentioned in my post on the future of organizations, communication technology is rapidly becoming cheaper and easier to access. People are now able to get information on everything happening in the world every second of the day. Since biology evolves over long timespans, fear and gossip still play a similar role in society today as they did when we were hunter gatherers.</p>\n<p>Media uses our fine-tuned biological desire for gossip to capture our attention with shows like the Kardashians. Staying on top of a constant stream of dramas and stories is time consuming. Our hunter gatherer selves only had to deal with the gossip of a small group of people. Now we try to keep up with the gossip of the entire world.</p>\n<p>The same thing is happening with fear. The biological function of fear keeps us alive. Before communication technologies, we were only aware of dangers in our immediate environment. Media opens us up to a flood of new dangers worldwide. It is overwhelming our biological selves which are fine tuned to pay attention to this type of fear.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of any profit-driven media organization, experimentation with different marketing strategies will naturally lead them to take advantage of our natural attention towards fear and gossip. Doing so increases viewer retention rates which grows the bottom line. Any altruistic organization who chooses not to create content touching on gossip or fear will be at a disadvantage to those who do.</p>\n<p>What is the end state? Will we continue to become evermore distracted by what the media presents to us? I have reasons to doubt the necessary change is possible in a capitalistic society.</p>\n<p>Compare the functions of capitalism to our biology. Capitalism creates an incentive for media companies to hold our attention. Biology has evolved to make us highly attentive to fear and gossip. As our environments change faster and faster, biology has been slow to catch up. Where fear and gossip evolved to to help us pay attention to life threatening scenarios, media can leverage it to increase profit. It’s a matter of incentives. Charlie Munger, Warren Buffet’s long-time investment partner, once said, “Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.” In a society where there are strong incentives to use fear and gossip to increase profit, it is difficult for a profit-driven organization not to do so. Perhaps the solution will come from outside capitalism.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of history, capitalism is a recent phenomenon. Markets solve many problems but also create new ones. Inequality between the have and have nots continues to grow and may serve as the catalyst that changes the structure of society. I have strong conviction that capitalism is not the final form of society. It’s only a step as society continues to change and learn.</p>"}
