However, in a complex world abundant in information, it is easy to get overwhelmed into inaction. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Knowledge is like a sphere; the greater its volume, the larger its contact with the unknown.”</p>\n<p>— Blaise Pascal</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Over time, I’ve slowly come to terms with the fact that I will only ever know the smallest sliver of everything there is to learn. I’m okay with that. Most everyone is winging it at this very moment. The key is to find the courage to act even though you don’t feel ready and don’t know all the answers. Form a hypothesis and commit fully to testing it. Answers will become clearer once you begin. Knowledge and application form a compounding positive feedback loop. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity</p>\n<p>- Richard Hamming</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Don’t worry about not being ready.
