I almost never get the question: ‘What’s not going to change in the next 10 years?’ And I submit to you that that second question is actually the more important of the two — because you can build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time.”</p>\n<p>- Jeff Bezos  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When it comes to predicting the next trend, humans <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/10/10-predictions-for-the-future-that-got-it-wildly-wrong/\">do</a> <a href=\"https://www.boredpanda.com/bad-future-predictions-timeline-history/?utm_source=google&#x26;utm_medium=organic&#x26;utm_campaign=organic\">terribly</a>. I like Jeff Bezo’s approach of asking instead, what won’t change? For Amazon, there are two things he knows that customers will still want 10 years from now.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Lower prices</li>\n<li>Faster deliveries</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This knowledge allows Amazon to invest heavily in improving these aspects of their business. They continue to invest in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/10/technology/amazon-robots-workers.html\">automating and improving the efficiency</a> of it’s warehouses saving time and money. They’ve also invested in building out a <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/06/technology/amazon-van-mercedes/index.html\">dedicated delivery fleet</a> in order to speed up delivery times. Both are costly endeavors based on these two foundational beliefs.</p>\n<p>This got me thinking about what things I believe won’t change. These are things I could bet big on knowing the investment of time, energy and resources will pay off in the long term.</p>\n<p><strong>What won’t change with human behavior?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We are social animals and desire the company of family, friends and people. Humans will never want to be more lonely.</li>\n<li>We are short term thinkers. We are bad at planning for the long term. The world behaves in exponentials and we often only see the linear day to day changes. </li>\n<li>We try to avoid the discomfort of change. It’s easier to stay in the same place, with the same friends or in the same career. Yet if we don’t explore different options, we can find ourselves stuck in a local maxima.</li>\n<li>We are storytellers. In order to wrap our heads around the complexity of the world, we craft stories. For example, religious stories attempt to explain our origins and design our moral compass. Learning to craft stories will make you a better writer and speaker.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What are some things you believe won’t change?
