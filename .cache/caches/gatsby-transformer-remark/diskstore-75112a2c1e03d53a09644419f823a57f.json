At the same time, new tools also create new problems. This is an ever repeating loop that I hope continues to trend slowly upwards. Here are some problems that I see today that I’d like to work on.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Create the world you want to inhabit”</p>\n<p>- Curious George</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Empathy</strong></p>\n<p>Humans naturally enjoy confirmation on their perspective. It reinforces who we are. It is much harder to engage with people of different backgrounds and opinions. Yet if we want to reach the truth, it is critical to do so. </p>\n<p>Imagine each of us is a small dot on a blank map. Given the limited number of experiences we can have ourselves, we will only ever uncover a small portion of the map. If we want to know what else exists, we will have to refer to other people’s experiences. I like to picture this when thinking about the importance of empathy. Tyler Cowen also explains the importance of empathy well in the tweet below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MQ%5C_McShane/status/1072197443301842944\">https://twitter.com/MQ\\_McShane/status/1072197443301842944</a></p>\n<p>Merging our perspective with another is deeply personal and requires forming a new reality of the world. To be open to new ideas requires admitting your own perspective may be wrong or only partially true. This can be painful (tweet below).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ikzauk/status/961363866780356608\">https://twitter.com/ikzauk/status/961363866780356608</a></p>\n<p>In a world that is becoming more and more complex, the piece of the map that any one person can hold is becoming smaller. But our online communities are becoming more polarized creating <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611807/this-is-what-filter-bubbles-actually-look-like/\">filter bubbles</a>.</p>\n<p>It will only become more critical that we can healthily engage in important conversations with groups of diverse perspectives. I’m currently thinking about how we can create spaces that enable healthy communication.</p>\n<p><strong>Community</strong></p>\n<p>The internet is becoming a powerful tool for enabling people to come together more seamlessly to collaborate and share. Remote work, collaborative tools and online communities are helping individuals who are passionate about problems to come together from anywhere in the world.</p>\n<p>As this space continues to grow, we will need powerful tools to help people discover others.</p>\n<p><strong>Creativity</strong></p>\n<p>There’s growing evidence that the internet has broadened the range of career opportunities. They just haven’t been discovered yet. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Twitch streamers building a community and career live streaming themselves playing games.</li>\n<li>Patreon enables creatives and artists to get paid through the support of those who enjoy their work.</li>\n<li>A wide group of makers (product hunt, indiehackers..) are building a career by solving their own problems.</li>\n<li>Soundcloud allows new artists to easily share their music and get discovered by people.</li>\n<li>Youtube personalities creating original content.</li>\n<li>Bloggers writing about the topics they are interested about</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As machines become capable of more and more work, we’ll need to find new careers. Technology has created opportunity to leverage our unique perspectives, interests and skills in a creative ways. However, the creative path is less known with a wider range of outcomes. Platforms that empower creators of all kinds will help lower the barriers to entry.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning</strong></p>\n<p>The 20th century required people to commit to memory large amounts of information to participate in the growing knowledge economy. The 21st century makes memorization obsolete since we can quickly find anything online. What we need now is the ability to understand what information is valuable. Universities are still teaching and testing students for their ability to memorize. Education this century needs to shift to teach students how to understand and analyze. This will require a massive upheaval of the old system and the construction of a new one from first principals. Some interesting problems to explore:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Syllabus 2.0: Internet allows us to search for information but how about acting as a guide to help us learn new topics?</li>\n<li>How can education better align with students? Some companies tackling this: Lambda School, Make School</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Loneliness</strong></p>\n<p>Our biology is wired for life in smaller, tight-knit tribes. The members of a tribe would help support each other with every aspect of life. With all the rapid advancements in human culture and society, our biology has not had a chance to keep up. We are more independent today with capitalism creating a clean interface for the exchange of goods and services. Yet independence is making loneliness a widespread pandemic. Since we don’t need to rely on anyone, we can go for days, months or years without deep social ties. Multiple studies have shown that loneliness has significant impacts on health.</p>\n<p>In an individualistic society, how can we introduce opportunities into our lives to connect meaningfully? Technology could help facilitate the formation of new relationships which could go on to grow organically.</p>"}
