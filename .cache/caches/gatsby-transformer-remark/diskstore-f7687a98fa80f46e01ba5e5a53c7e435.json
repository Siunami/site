I have started multiple blogs only for them to sputter out after a few posts. Each time, what stopped me was fear. Fear of being wrong. Fear of someone finding a flaw in my thought process. Fear of sharing something radical that broke from the status quo. Slowly, I am realizing that these barriers are the exact things that will help me grow.</p>\n<p>In sharing my thoughts here, I want to make a commitment to myself and to those who read what I share to follow three principles.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To share with radical honesty</li>\n<li>To be vulnerable and open to new or opposing perspectives</li>\n<li>To change my opinions in response to valid arguments</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Lastly, a note on why I want to write in the first place. My goal is to share my own thinking in the hopes of sparking conversation and connecting with people around the world. Looking forward to meeting you all.Â ðŸ˜ƒ</p>"}
