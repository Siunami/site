This podcast went into greater depth on his thoughts related to desire, personal freedom, pursuing truth, the root of confidence, dangers in our environment and that life is suffering. What I like about Kapil is his ability to extract broad truths about life and for sharing his honest perspective.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+KebueAwmg\">#353: Patrick Collison - CEO of Stripe - The Tim Ferriss Show</a></p>\n<p>This conversation ranged from Patrick’s experience growing up in rural Ireland, founding Stripe and his worldview. What particularly resonated with me was his way of thinking about current situations. For example, it’s easy to find reasons why some experiment will go wrong but we should be celebrating the people willing to take the risk. The ones who succeed push society forward.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.perell.com/blog/coolest-things-2018\">Coolest Things I Learned In 2018</a></p>\n<p>David Perell’s mission is to accelerate the spread of interesting ideas. He hosts a popular podcast interviewing people about society, technology and learning among other things. This list was a fun and interesting read of lesser known ideas.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Painters-Big-Ideas-Computer/dp/1449389554\">Hackers &#x26; Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age</a></p>\n<p>Hackers &#x26; Painters is a collection of Paul Grahams essays as both a hacker and painter. What might seem like opposite skill sets at first have a surprising amount in common. His essays go into topics like what environments hackers/painters thrive in, how to make wealth, differences in programming languages and building startups.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sovereign-Individual-Mastering-Transition-Information/dp/0684832720/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1547708659&#x26;sr=8-1&#x26;keywords=the+sovereign+individual\">The Sovereign Individual: Mastering the Transition to the Information Age</a>  </p>\n<p>The core thesis of The Sovereign Individual is that information technology will cause megapolitical change. Written in the 90s, many of the predictions made by the authors have come true while some have yet to be seen. They argue that throughout history, as the means of power and violence change, the structure of society changes along with it. The transition to the information age is changing the logic of violence and will have effects on societal structure as well.</p>"}
