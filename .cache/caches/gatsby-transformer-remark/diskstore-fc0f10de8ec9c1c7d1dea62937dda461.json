The book attempts to make bold predictions about the megapolitical changes that are coming due to microprocessing in the new information age. First things first. What is megapolitics?</p>\n<p>Megapolitics attempts to extract major structural patterns that repeat throughout history. The factors leading to megapolitical change include topography, climate, microbes and technology. By taking into account how different factors influence human incentives, you can better identify the implications of change. This perspective allows you to perceive with greater clarity the rising and falling of governments, economies, cultures and violence.</p>\n<p><strong>Topology</strong> has played a critical role in human control and prosperity throughout history. For example, during the agricultural age, farmers were highly dependent on access to irrigation for crops. To see the importance of water on the shape of society, you can compare the agricultural societies of Egypt and Greece.</p>\n<p>Egypt had a rich source of irrigation through the floodplains. As populations rose, greater competition for valuable farmland put a strain on the individual farmer. Leaving the floodplains was not an option since without water, farmers would starve. Those with control of the water were in a position of power and riches. Those without lived a life on the margin.</p>\n<p>In Greece, an elaborate shoreline ensured most people were near the sea. This allowed them to quickly transport high value goods like oils and wine without significant spoilage on the journey. Greek farmers enjoyed high incomes from small pieces of land allowing them greater upward mobility. They could also purchase weapons and armor to defend themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Climate</strong> creates the boundary conditions in which people can prosper. Understanding the dynamics of climate change can allow you to better understand how fluctuations in weather might affect the world today. For example, take the knowledge that a 1 degree celsius drop leads to a reduced growing season by three to four weeks and reduces the max elevation that crops can grow by 500 feet. This provides information you can use to predict changes from the value of land to the price of different crops.</p>\n<p>In history, sudden changes in climate change has often lead to political instability. For societies that are already in a fragile state, a sudden decrease in incomes or crop yields could tip the scales for revolution.</p>\n<p><strong>Microbes</strong> have the ability to harm or provide immunity from harm. When European settlers encountered Native Americans for the first time, Native American populations were decimated since they lacked immunity to many diseases. Another example was malaria in the tropical parts of Africa. Europeans with all their weapons were incapable of invading for centuries because of the disease.</p>\n<p>As humans gained immunity from more diseases, family sizes shrank since children were more likely to survive. This led to a cultural shift where families became less tolerant to deaths. Imperialism faded due to its heavy cost on human life.</p>\n<p><strong>Technology</strong> has played the largest role in megapolitical change in the recent centuries. When technology and in particular, weapons are more accessible to individuals, the size of society decreases. Individuals and small groups are able to manage their interests themselves. When technology is less accessible, power consolidates creating larger societies. Accessibility includes the cost, organization and/or distribution of key technologies.</p>\n<p>Cost: When weapons are relatively cheap, individuals are able to acquire them. Compare heavy cavalry to rifles. Heavy cavalry were expensive allowing the knights who owned them to exercise a large amount of control over peasants. Rifles were much cheaper allowing individuals to hold their ground.</p>\n<p>Organization: When weapons require a large amount of organization to use, the size of societies increase. Take for example missile technology which is impossible to wield without high levels of organization.</p>\n<p>Distribution: When key technology is monopolized or hoarded, power tends to centralize. When key technology is dispersed, power shifts towards empowering the individual.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is this all important?</strong></p>\n<p>Past revolutions, such as the agricultural or industrial revolutions, occurred over thousands or hundreds of years. The shift to the information revolution due to advancements in computing and microprocessors could happen in a lifetime. Therefore, being aware of the underlying reasons and understanding how to prepare for megapolitical change will be of greater importance. My plan is to extract the major themes of the book into a series of blog posts for my own understanding and to share with you. Stay tuned.</p>"}
