Well.. nearly stopped. I still use it for 1-on-1 messaging with friends and for occasionally sharing an event. Besides that, I’ve deleted all apps on my phone and installed a handy “kill my newsfeed” chrome extension that removes the Facebook newsfeed whenever I use it on my laptop. There were a few reasons I did this some of which I’m sure you’re well aware of.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Time waster. The business model of social media is in selling your attention. Therefore, they are incentivized to design highly addictive experiences. With infinite scrolling apps like Instagram and Facebook, you never know when you’re going to see an interesting piece of content. It’s like playing the slot machines as you scroll and scroll waiting to win.</li>\n<li>Increased loneliness. The filtered lives of people online gives off the feeling that you were the only one who hasn’t figured it out yet. I think while everyone experiences normal ups and downs, the culture of these platforms is to only share the good moments. There is validation only on a superficial level many times. It depends on how you use it but at the time I stopped, I felt social media was not helping me maintain <strong>meaningful</strong> connections.</li>\n<li>Psychological manipulation. No ones reads the terms of agreement but by accepting it, you basically give social media companies complete control over your data. They sell this information to third parties who can use it to <a href=\"http://time.com/5197255/facebook-cambridge-analytica-donald-trump-ads-data/\">manipulate you</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>2 years ago, I initially wanted to delete my accounts permanently. I quickly discovered an unfortunate reality. A combination of network effects and other useful utilities like login with X made it incredibly difficult to leave their platform without losing a lot. Deleting my accounts would have completely severed connections with hundreds of people I’ve met throughout the years. Also, a variety of web applications where I’ve used the conveniently placed login with X features would be unusable. A big part of the reason these companies are so valuable is that they make it very difficult to leave their platform. I’m excited about some of the <a href=\"https://deletefacebook.wiki/?ref=producthunt\">initiatives</a> to suggest alternatives to the major social media platforms.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I’m really glad I chose to stop using social media as often. There was a sense that I was missing out on things for a while but over time, I found I enjoyed catching up in person much more.</p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/social-media/"],"slug":"/posts/why-i-stopped-using-social-media/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why I stopped using social media","tags":["social media"],"date":"2018-12-23","description":"It's been two years since I've stopped using personal social media.
