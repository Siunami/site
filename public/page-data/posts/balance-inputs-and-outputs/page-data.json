I’m okay with that. Most everyone is winging it at this very moment. The key is to find the courage to act even though you don’t feel ready and don’t know all the answers. Form a hypothesis and commit fully to testing it. Answers will become clearer once you begin. Knowledge and application form a compounding positive feedback loop. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity</p>\n<p>- Richard Hamming</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Don’t worry about not being ready.
