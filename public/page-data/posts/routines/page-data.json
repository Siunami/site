By controlling your environment and removing external stimuli, it allows you to focus and make significant progress. <a href=\"http://memory.psych.missouri.edu/doc/articles/2001/Cowan%20BBS%202001.pdf\">Short-term memory can hold approximately 4 chunks of information</a> at any given time. On a normal day, these chunks are typically spread across a wide variety of unrelated tasks and strained in a hundred different directions throughout the day. When routine makes the day predictable, these blocks of short-term memory can be focused on a singular goal. Connections are made much faster since the entire short-term memory is holding chunks relevant to that goal. In this way, routines help induce flow state or the feeling of complete immersion with the task at hand leading to rapid progress.</p>\n<p>Yet stay in a routine for too long and the days begin to blend together. Each day begins to look like each other. Routines are susceptible to becoming boring. The mind loves the novelty that routines try to remove. Inspiration to reach a goal can slowly dry up and progress can begin to slow.</p>\n<p>There is balance between having and not having a routine. Having a routine can help you make progress. Not having a routine allows you to explore and find new sources of inspiration. A routine without inspiration is dreadfully boring. Constant inspiration and exploration without routine can be distracting if you have a goal in mind. The key point here is that for the goal driven person, neither can exist alone.</p>\n<p>I like to think of routine as a part of a continuous cycle. You explore the world and allow it to influence you. Find new inspiration, learn new things and identify new directions youâ€™d like to go. Then once you have a goal, routines allow you to focus deeply on the challenges to reach that goal. When you either complete the goal or begin to run low on inspiration and energy, switch back to explore mode.</p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/notes/"],"slug":"/posts/routines/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Routines","tags":["notes"],"date":"2019-02-15","description":"There is balance between having and not having a routine.
