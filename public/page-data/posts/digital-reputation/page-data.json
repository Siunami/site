For example, The New York Times would publish lists of best selling books in its papers. Given their wide audience, the lists had to have broad appeal. Publishing a list of books on only a single topic would have alienated many readers. For products and services that were less popular, we relied on word of mouth to discover what was good.</p>\n<p>With the internet, we had a way to amplify word of mouth to reach a larger number of people. Companies built entire businesses around amplifying people’s word of mouth.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon amplifies word of mouth for products</li>\n<li>Uber and Lift amplify word of mouth for drivers</li>\n<li>Yelp amplifies word of mouth for restaurants.</li>\n<li>Reddit amplifies word of mouth for information</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It became possible for anyone to quickly find reviews for the best Italian restaurant in a city, the most popular articles on artificial intelligence and the best books related to gardening. People’s opinions in the form of online reviews became critical to any product or service’s success.</p>\n<p>In the infancy of online reviews, businesses used them to improve their offering. However, many today are using reviews dishonestly. In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj-tRTbFfY\">video by the Wall Street Journal</a>, they uncovered some of the tricks used to beat out competitors in Amazon product niches. This includes leaving large amounts of negative reviews on competing products, propping up their own products with positive reviews and bribing Amazon employees to improve their product page ranking. Entire <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/amazon-fake-review-problem\">markets have formed around buying reviews</a>.</p>\n<p>Review spam is hard to stop since real user accounts and spam accounts have no obvious differences. While Amazon’s systems for policing spam accounts are improving, the core problem is that sellers can easily create new accounts and repeat the process. Especially for smaller niche products, review spam can quickly move a bad product up to the top. This is leading people to <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/heres-why-amazon-cant-fix-review-spam-1825955852\">revert back to using trusted parties</a> to decide what is good.</p>\n<p>Relying on trusted parties only covers a small portion of the products and services out there. The optimal review system would be one where we could leverage the collective word of mouth for trusted accounts only. That way we could get real quality reviews on the widest variety of products and services. There may be a path to get there today.</p>\n<p>Blockchain could allow us to build a robust identity reputation system across many platforms. Using <a href=\"https://blockgeeks.com/guides/smart-contracts/\">smart contracts</a>, we could attach a reputation score to an individual’s account that is aggregated across the platforms they use. Over time, reputation would accumulate increasing the trust an individual account has. Reviews from accounts with greater reputation would have a greater influence. Any account that posts spam reviews would be blocked just as they are today. If they try to create a new account to post spam reviews, they will have to restart with zero reputation. Since digital reputation takes time to build, this would curb the ability of spam accounts to influence reviews.</p>\n<p>The internet has successfully amplified word of mouth regardless of who it is. The next step is to selectively amplify individuals who can be trusted. Digital reputation mediated by the blockchain could help us get there.</p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":null,"slug":"/posts/digital-reputation/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Digital reputation","tags":null,"date":"2018-12-29","description":"Thoughts on how to build a digital reputation system for trusted reviews.
