I have started multiple blogs only for them to sputter out after a few posts. Each time, what stopped me was fear. Fear of being wrong. Fear of someone finding a flaw in my thought process. Fear of sharing something radical that broke from the status quo. Slowly, I am realizing that these barriers are the exact things that will help me grow.</p>\n<p>In sharing my thoughts here, I want to make a commitment to myself and to those who read what I share to follow three principles.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To share with radical honesty</li>\n<li>To be vulnerable and open to new or opposing perspectives</li>\n<li>To change my opinions in response to valid arguments</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Lastly, a note on why I want to write in the first place. My goal is to share my own thinking in the hopes of sparking conversation and connecting with people around the world.
